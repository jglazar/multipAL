# multipAL

multipAL is an active learning package that optimizes material compositions to maximize one or more properties. MultipAL works closely in tandem with the NIST JARVIS DFT database and VASP DFT software. It implements a random forest regressor to make predictions and quantifies the uncertainties using the ForestCI package.
